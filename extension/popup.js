/**
 * popup.js
 * 
 * Handles the logic for the extension's popup window.
 * 
 * Phase 1 Responsibilities:
 * - None, as there are no interactive elements in the popup yet.
 * 
 * Future Responsibilities (as per the mind map):
 * - Handle clicks on buttons (e.g., a "Settings" button).
 * - Send messages to the background script or content scripts.
